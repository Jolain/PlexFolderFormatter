name: Plex Content Formatter
developper: dev_JP (
description: >
    Repairs the folder and file naming of a directory to match the
    structure required by Plex Media Center. Can roughly figure out
    the name of the serie/movie contained in a given directory.
    
    Sadly, currently only works on a movie or tv show library. :(
    I'm a student and spare time is unfortunately rare. But eventually
    supporting the sports, music and other libraries is planned for
    this project.
    
    Example:
        - Desc: Fix the formatting of a movie library with 2 movies.
            ...\Movies\The.Incredibles.2004.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-XXXX.mkv
            ...\Movies\Exodus.Gods.And.Kings.2014.TELESYNC.XViD.XXX.avi
            
        - Usage: plex_format_util --movie <plex_library_dir>\Movies\
        
        - Result: Renamed the incorrectly named movies.
            ...\Movies\The Incredibles (2004).mkv
            ...\Movies\Exodus Gods And Kings (2014).avi
            
    Example:
        - Desc: Fix the formatting of a TV show library with 1 season.
            ...\TV Shows\The.Big.Bang.Theory.Season.10.Complete.720p.WEB.x264-XXXX
                \TV Shows\<snip>\The.Big.Bang.Theory.S10E01.The.Conjugal.Conjecture.720p.WEB.x264-[XXXX].mp4
                \TV Shows\<snip>\The.Big.Bang.Theory.S10E02.The.Military.Miniaturization.720p.WEB.x264-[XXXX].mp4
                ...
                
        - Usage: plex_format_util --serie <plex_library_dir>\TV Shows\
        
        - Result: Renamed the incorrectly named episodes and folders.
            ...\TV Shows\The Big Bang Theory Season 10
                \TV Shows\<snip>\The Big Bang Theory S10E01.mp4
                \TV Shows\<snip>\The Big Bang Theory S10E02.mp4
